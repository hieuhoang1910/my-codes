# My Engineering Project Repository

Welcome! This repository contains a collection of engineering code projects I've developed across aerospace, thermal, mechanical, and experimental domains. Each subfolder represents a complete, self-contained project, including source code, test data (if applicable), and documentation.

## 📁 Project Index

###  [FEA-Beam-Problem](FEA-Beam-Problem/)
A Python-based Finite Element Analysis script to solve axial deformation in a 1D bar using stiffness matrix assembly. Includes reaction force and nodal displacement calculation.

###  [Shock-Tube-Analysis](Shock-Tube-Analysis/)
Analyzes pressure transducer data from a shock tube experiment. Computes shock strength, Mach number, and visualizes pressure wave propagation from CSV voltage data.

###  [Turbojet-Engine-Performance](Turbojet-Engine-Performance/)
Estimates turbine and compressor efficiency from experimental turbojet engine data using thermodynamic relations and ideal gas assumptions.

###  [Uncertainty-RSM-Analysis](Uncertainty-RSM-Analysis/)
Demonstrates uncertainty quantification using Monte Carlo simulations and a sample response surface model. Useful for probabilistic engineering design.

###  [Vehicle-Efficiency-Model](Vehicle-Efficiency-Model/)
Models power requirements of a vehicle due to rolling resistance and aerodynamic drag. Useful for estimating EV/hybrid energy consumption.

###  [Voltage-Conversion-Script](Voltage-Conversion-Script/)
Converts voltage readings from pressure transducers to psi using known sensitivity. Ideal for automation of lab data analysis.
